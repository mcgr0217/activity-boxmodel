        <p>Ayia Napa is a big resort with loads going on day and night throughout the summer. There are shops with everything from souvenirs and beach wear to jewellery and designer label fashion. You can bungee jump, ride the slingshot, ride a bucking bronco or scuba dive. You can go to a beach party, a pool party, a foam party, on a boat trip or a bar crawl. There are hairdressers, tattooistsâ€™, beauticians and gyms, as well as dance classes and fitness instructors.</p>
        
        <h2>Nissi Beach</h2>
        
        <p>Nissi Beach is the most popular beach in the Ayia Napa area and probably the most well known on the island of Cyprus. It is made up of 2 connecting beaches, one long and lively, the other smaller and quieter. The beaches have golden sands and the waters are clean and clear. It is possible to walk out for up to a hundred metres without the water passing your waist and there are many sand bars in the shallows.</p>

        <p>The Eastern end of the beach is fairly quiet and relaxing. In contrast the central area is home to the Nissi Bay Beach Bar which draws crowds with it's daily programme of amusements including top name DJ's, foam parties, beach parties and other events. 
Nissi is definitely the beach to visit to see and be seen with more posing and preening going on than dedicated sun bathing. During the peak months you can expect loud music, lots of bling, plenty of makeup and very little clothing in the area around the Nissi bay beach bar.</p>
        
        <h3>Konnos Bay</h3>
        
        <p>Konnos Bay is at the most Eastern edge of Ayia Napa and is the jewel in the Cape Greco national park. Situated midway between Ayia Napa and Protaras, Konnos Bay attracts a mix of visitors from both resorts and is also very popular with local people, especially at weekends and during national holidays. The white sand beach melts into crystal clear waters which are a favourite spot for private yachts and motorboats to drop anchor for a few hours. 
The high rocky headlands on either side of the beach are fringed with pine trees with various viewing points on the winding road down to the beach from which spectacular photographs can be taken. To reach the beach, visitors can either take this road which leads to a small car park, or use the steps which lead down from the Grecian Park Hotel at the top of the cliff.</p>

        <p>One unique feature of this beach are the sun loungers which are available to rent daily from the attendant on the beach. The moulded plastic loungers can be picked up and taken in the sea where they become floating sunbeds. 
A small cafe bar nestles in the pine trees is available for refreshments and there are numerous watersports available including a wide range of inflatables such as ringo's, flying fish and bananas as well as motorised sports.</p>
        
        <h4>Macronissos Beach</h4>
        
        <p>Macronissos Beach is actually 3 beach in one. The main beach is long with golden sand and is flanked by two smaller bays also with golden sand sand clear waters. These beaches are found at the western edge of Ayia Napa and always attract a mix of tourists and local people. The atmosphere is laid back making them ideal for relaxing in the sun with a good book.</p>

        <p>The beaches are also popular with families with young children due to the gently shelving sands and calm atmosphere. Watersports are available as well as a snack bar for refreshments. 
The beaches are reachable from Nissi Avenue by car or bicycle and are also at the end of the bus route which terminates at the nearby waterpark. During the winter kite surfers can occasionally be seen here if the winds are right.</p>
